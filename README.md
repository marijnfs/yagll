YOPL: Your Own Programming Language
==================================
Tired of your programming language? Why not build your own!

YOPL allows you to define your own programming language.
Using an __LL(\*)__ parser, fast __RE2__ regular expression matching, and an __LLVM__ backend, you can have a new programming language in notime.
The LL(*) parser can also be used on its own, e.g. to create your own config file reader.

- LL(\*) parser with RE2 matching is working
- LLVM backend is work in progress
